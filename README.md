# python-challenge
Two projects including one creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company and another helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

## PyBank

For the first challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. I was given a set of  financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset was composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* In addition, the final script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

* In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. I was given a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset was composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. My task was to create a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

In addition, the final script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.
